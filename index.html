                    Two decades and 7 years ago, a wee little child was born. 
                    Little did she know that her life was going to change drastically. Or not.
                    At this point I am here wondering if it was a wise decision to not bargain for a Loerum Ipsum 
                    because as I have come to realize writing about myself is one of the hardest things ever.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        A lover of Arts, an appreciator of the Sciences. I find pleasure in solitude and in my 
                        thoughts. However, I also enjoy the company of my family and friends. I'm anxious around 
                        people sometimes but they can't tell.

                            Books are a favorite past-time. That's about it, nothing to see here. Just a boring child!
